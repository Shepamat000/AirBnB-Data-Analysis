# AirBnB Data Analysis
Python project utilizing Scikit-Learn to analyze and predict an AirBnB Kaggle dataset

By Matthew Shepard, Caden Ross, Jareth McGhee, and Gianfranco Bruno Cheng

This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze AirBnB data (provided by Kaggle under a public use license). These include decision tree and bayesian network algorithms (featured in src/Trees/trees.py), logistic regression (LogisticRegressionTest.py), and xgboost (xgboost_model.py). Overall, the results for each of the algorithms were relatively high compared to similar designs on Kaggle, but XGBoost proved the most effective at an 88.5% accuracy, which places the design in the upper bracket of the Kaggle results.  

Requirements:
Python3 installation
Scikit-learn, Numpy, and Pandas python packages
